Being a developer sometimes teaches us that `we have to work a lot more that other people`<p font-style:italic>(MHA)</p>

At the end of this development, I aim to familiarize these framework, libraries, tools and development work-flow. Yet for me it requires a great deal of self-discipline since most of the times I fail to priorities my tasks.

Any suggestions will be much appreciated.
